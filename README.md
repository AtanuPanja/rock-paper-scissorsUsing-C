# rock-paper-scissorsUsing-C

This is a very exciting project. This is my first ever dynamic project in C.🔥🔥🔥

Here we'll play  a minimalist, yet interesting, Rock Paper Scissors game.

The game will be You V/S the Computer. (Don't worry no cheating is done here😅😅, if you play strategically😎😎, you can win it.)

You'll be given three rounds to play. To be the winner, you must win at least two rounds.

You will enjoy it!!!👌👌👌
