# rock-paper-scissorsUsing-C

This is a very exciting project. This is my first ever dynamic project in C.ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥

Here we'll play  a minimalist, yet interesting, Rock Paper Scissors game.

The game will be You V/S the Computer.

You'll be given three rounds to play. To be the winner, you must win at least two rounds.

You will enjoy it!!!ğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘Œ
